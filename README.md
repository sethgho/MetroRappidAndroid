# MetroRappid for Android

On the Google Play store by the end of the week.



## Problem

- People don't ride the bus because it can seem unreliable: buses arrive anytime from 10 minutes before their scheduled time to 20 minutes after
- The solution to that is realtime data
- But if the realtime data is hard to access, people won't use it
- The MetroRapid (801) and MetroRail (550) routes have realtime data
- Only CapMetro's official app have access to that realtime data
- But, CapMetro's app is hard to use. See [CapMetroApp: When should I take the bus home?](https://github.com/sethgho/MetroRappidAndroid/wiki/CapMetro-App---When-should-I-take-the-bus-home)]


# What we did

Reverse engineer CapMetro's app and find their hidden API.

Use that API to get the realtime data.

Build an Android app that shows realtime arrivals for MetroRapid and MetroRail, really quickly.
