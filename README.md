# Problem

- People don't ride the bus because it can seem unreliable: buses arrive anytime from 10 minutes before their scheduled time to 20 minutes after
- The solution to that is realtime data
- But if the realtime data is hard to access, people won't use it
- The MetroRapid (801) and MetroRail (550) routes have realtime data
- Only CapMetro's official app have access to that realtime data

## CapMetroApp: When should I take the bus home?

1. Open the app ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1275831/3141818/f4de4730-e99a-11e3-82f9-c142f969a315.jpg)
2. Click Next Bus ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1275831/3141815/f4d64f94-e99a-11e3-9e92-b9cae1cde10c.jpg)
3. Wait for the webpage inside the app to load ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1275831/3141814/f4d5966c-e99a-11e3-8cad-3f628b0cc55c.jpg)

6. Allow the webpage to use your location every time you open the app ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1275831/3141822/f4e766ee-e99a-11e3-9d89-4aa3c3f87b6d.jpg)

8. Scroll through the list of stops until you find a stop with 801-N (MetroRapid bus going North), ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1275831/3141823/f4e7b5f4-e99a-11e3-9b70-995980068194.jpg)

And you're done. 19 Minutes until the next bus gets here.

# What we did

Reverse engineer CapMetro's app and find their hidden API.

Use that API to get the realtime data.

Build an Android app that shows realtime arrivals for MetroRapid and MetroRail, really quickly.
