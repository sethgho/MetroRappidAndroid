On the Google Play store by the end of the week.

## Problem

- People don't ride the bus because it can seem unreliable: buses arrive anytime from 10 minutes before their scheduled time to 20 minutes after
- The solution to that is realtime data
- But if the realtime data is hard to access, people won't use it
- The MetroRapid (801) and MetroRail (550) routes have realtime data
- Only CapMetro's official app have access to that realtime data
- But, CapMetro's app is hard to use. See [CapMetroApp: When should I take the bus home?](https://github.com/sethgho/MetroRappidAndroid/wiki/CapMetro-App---When-should-I-take-the-bus-home)


##Solution

We reversed engineer CapMetro's app to find their hidden API. We also created[documentation for the hidden/secret CapMetro API](https://github.com/luqmaan/MetroRappid/wiki/The-CapMetro-API).
We then used that API to get the realtime data, and built an Android app that shows realtime arrivals for MetroRapid and MetroRail, really quickly.

Step 1. Select A Route
And Direction

Step 2. 
MetroRappid automatically finds the nearest stop and vehicle

Step 3. Get on the bus
